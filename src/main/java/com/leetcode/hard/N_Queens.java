 * The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
 * <p>
 * Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
 * <p>
 * Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
 * where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: 4
 * Output: [
 *  [".Q..",  // Solution 1
 *   "...Q",
 *   "Q...",
 *   "..Q."],
 *
 *  ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
 *   "Q...",
 *   "...Q",
 *   ".Q.."]
 * ]
 * Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.
