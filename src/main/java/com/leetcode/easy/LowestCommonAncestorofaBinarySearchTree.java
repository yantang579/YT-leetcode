 * Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
 * <p>
 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
 * “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants
 * (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 *
 * 注：
 * BST：binary search tree or binary sort tree（二叉排序树，二叉线索树都是一样的定义，就是node的左子树比node值小，node值比右子树的值小）
